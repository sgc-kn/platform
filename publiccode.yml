    shortDescription: >
      Integrations, modules and jobs for the City of Konstanz climate data
      platform.
      
    longDescription: >
      This repository contains the technical integrations for the City of
      Konstanz’s climate data platform. It consolidates diverse sources—e.g.,
      weather stations (DWD and city-operated), traffic and bicycle counts, air
      quality (LUBW), water levels, solar and charging infrastructure, MobiData
      BW, and internal metrics—, cleans and persists them as time series, and
      exposes them via APIs and dashboards in a unified, policy‑compliant
      infrastructure. It supports internal workflows, evidence‑based planning
      (e.g., winter service, mobility analysis, climate adaptation), and public
      transparency.
      
    features:
      - >-
        Time series ingestion from official, operational and municipal sources
        (e.g., DWD, LUBW, BASt, Pegelonline, Eco‑Counter, MobiData BW, MaStR,
        city stations)
      - >-
        Persistence in Timescale/Postgres and exposure via APIs (incl. NGSI‑LD
        via Stellio/Quantumleap, PostgREST) and dashboards (Grafana)
      - >-
        Implementations as Node‑RED flows and Python notebooks; experimental
        orchestration with Dagster and Airflow
